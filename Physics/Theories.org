* Theories

** Laws of Motion

*First law of motion* : A body continues to be in its state of rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless an external unbalanced force is applied on it.

*Second Law of Motion* : The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied on it and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force.

*Third Law of Motion* : To every action, there is always equal and opposite reaction

** Work, Energy and Power 

*Work Energy Theorem* : The work-energy theorem states that the work done on an object by the net force is equal to the change in its kinetic energy.

** Thermal properties of matter

** Principle of calorimetry : The principle of calorimetry (or principle of mixtures) states that for an insulated system, heat energy lost by the hot body is equal to the heat energy gained by the cold body.

*Wien's displacement law* states that the black body radiation curve for different temperatures peaks at a wavelength inversely proportional to the temperature.
