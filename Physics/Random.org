** Motion
$\text{-/+} \longleftarrow \longrightarrow \text{+/-}$

Direction should always be considered /even in distances/

For maximum speed/velocity $\frac{dv}{dt}$ or acceleration is considered 0.

In direction related questions try using $\hat{i} \hat{j} \hat{k}$

Cars  topple when the sideways acceleration exceeds friction angular

+If gravity, elasticity or any potential energy related force is not present there is no importance in considering potential energy in total conservation of momentum.+

When two bodies collide their momentum and energy changes

| Elastic collision | Inelastic Collision |
|-+-|
| Total momentum and energy are conserved | Total momentum and energy are conserved |
| Total KE is not conserved | Total KE is not conserved |
| Object does not stick together and do not move in the same direction | Object stick together and moves in the same direction |

Total angular momentum remains conserved

when linear and angular momentum is zero the body is said to be at equilibrium

Centre of mass of a body is the point at which the total gravitational torque on the body is zero

Types of thermal expansion in solids

$\text{Linear}\longrightarrow 1D$
$\text{Superficial}\longrightarrow 2D$
$\text{Cubic}\longrightarrow 3D$
