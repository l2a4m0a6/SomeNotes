Internal energy of gas depends on *temperature* and *pressure*

*Heat capacity* of the system is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of the system through $1^oC$

*Gibbs free energy* is the maximum amount of non-expansion work that can be extracted from a *thermodynamically closed system*
maximum can be attained only in a completely reversible process.
